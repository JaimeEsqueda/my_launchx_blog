      <description>Hello that much pleasure I am Jaime Esqueda and today I am going to tell you about my experience in a great adventure that I had the opportunity to belong. It is a full stack developer course taught by Microsoft experts. That&amp;rsquo;s right, at first it seemed like a dream, since I was just starting my learning curve to this area in a self-taught way and without much success. At the beginning of the induction week, I found it quite interesting how Python looks a lot like other database management systems that I had previously worked on.</description>
