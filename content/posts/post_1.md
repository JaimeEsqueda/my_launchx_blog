Hello that much pleasure I am Jaime Esqueda and today I am going to tell you about my experience in a great adventure that I had the opportunity to belong. It is a full stack developer course taught by Microsoft experts. That's right, at first it seemed like a dream, since I was just starting my learning curve to this area in a self-taught way and without much success. At the beginning of the induction week, I found it quite interesting how Python looks a lot like other database management systems that I had previously worked on. I really liked the induction week as I learned a lot of python about its syntax since the themes for me were not a problem. Entering the Front End, I loved the way they explained the Development Lyfe Cycle, from there everything began to make sense for me, from the documentation that was a challenge to adapt, although I really like working with documents so I get familiar. Even the asynchronous programming with html, css and frameworks such as JavaScript, Vue, Vuex and Angular, the truth where my learning curve is most is in practicing css and the different tools that frameworks have for us.
So far it has been my experience, I am very excited in this part of back end since I consider myself good at creating macros in excel with connections, queries and managing databases, part of data mining and object-oriented programming has been my forte.
I am super attentive and to serve you, I would love to make friends.

Saludos
