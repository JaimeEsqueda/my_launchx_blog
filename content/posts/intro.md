Hello Everobody there, For me, the culture of a software developer consists of the following values::

- Respect
- Responsibility
- Honesty
- Good communication 
- Proactive attitude
- Trust

As well as philosophy of life a continuous improvement in its administration and process management, thus improving its discipline for a better result in each project.
